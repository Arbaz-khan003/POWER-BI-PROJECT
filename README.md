Objectives
The main goal is to provide insights into global health spending trends and support decision-making in healthcare by addressing questions like:

Which countries or regions have the highest and lowest health expenditure?
What is the health expenditure as a percentage of GDP?
How does health expenditure change year-to-year?
Data Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes:

Calculating health expenditure metrics using DAX functions.
Creating visualizations, such as line charts for yearly trends, bar charts for comparing countries, scatter plots for expenditure vs. GDP, and maps for geographical distributions.
Insights into trends and regional variations in global health spending.
